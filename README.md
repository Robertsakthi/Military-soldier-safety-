### **Project Title:**

**Military Soldier Safety and Weapon Detection Using YOLO and Computer Vision**

---

### **Project Description:**

This project aims to enhance **soldier safety and security in defense operations** by leveraging **real-time object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once)** and **Computer Vision** techniques. The system is designed to automatically detect weapons and monitor threats in live video feeds, providing timely alerts and enhancing situational awareness on the battlefield.

Using YOLO, a deep learning-based object detection model, the system processes video streams to identify and classify dangerous objects such as guns, knives, and other weapons. Integration with OpenCV and Streamlit allows for a user-friendly, interactive dashboard where security personnel can monitor feeds and receive real-time notifications.

The solution focuses on minimizing response time, reducing human error, and providing soldiers and command units with intelligent surveillance tools.

### **Technologies Used:**

* **Python:** Core programming language used for model development and integration.
* **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** Real-time object detection algorithm for identifying weapons.
* **Computer Vision:** Image processing for video analysis and threat recognition.
* **OpenCV:** Image and video processing framework used for camera feed capture and frame handling.
* **Streamlit:** Web application framework to build an interactive user interface for real-time monitoring.
